# Everplans Mobile Codetest Solution

This project is my solution to the [Everplans Mobile Codetest](https://github.com/everplans/mobile-codetest). However, in discussions with Bernie it was decided that it should be completed for the browser and not a mobile device as it was originally intended. Additionally, since the supplied designs were for one mobile screen size my project should be viewed on a 375px width screen. To see what my ultimate intent was in implementing the designs it should be viewed in the iPhone 6/7/8 mobile setting in your browser's dev tools.

## To run the project locally

Once you have cloned it, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Again, to view the project as I intended set your browser as instructed above.

## To run the tests

### `npm test`
